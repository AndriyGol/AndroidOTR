Modification of OTR4J for Andoid.
see https://github.com/jitsi/otr4j

Note, that I need to create a fork of the original project. For now I simply modified it for Android. The history contains commits from OTR4J people. 
The library uses http://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/

How to use:
1. mvn clean install
2. Add maven dependency to ur project.
